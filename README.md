# nav
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/taylorlapeyre/nav.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/taylorlapeyre/nav)

Do you want to match URLs to handlers using Ring? Me too. That's why I made nav.

### Features
- Extremely small (< 50 lines)
- Will route URLs to handler functions
- Is easily extendable
- Is easy to understand

### Installation

Add this to your Leiningen :dependencies:

```
[nav "0.1.0"]
```

### Usage

Nav is one function. The function takes a specially formatted map and turns it into a [ring][ring] handler function. That's all there is to it.

A route map looks like this:

``` clojure
(def routes {
  [:get  "/items"]    items-handler
  [:get "/items/:id"] item-handler
})
```

Of course, this might be a pain to write. So I provide some helper functions as well:

``` clojure
(use 'nav.core)
(def routes
  (-> (GET "/items"     items-handler)
      (GET "/items/:id" item-handler)))
```

The result of this is exactly equivalent to the previous code.

You may notice that you can use named url parameters. These are merged directly into the `:params` key in your request map.

Finally, to create your handler, simply pass the route map into the provided function `route` and use it in your application.

``` clojure
(ns myapp.core
  (:use org.httpkit.server
        ring.middleware.json
        ring.util.response
        nav.core))

(defn items#show
  [request]
  (let [data (json/encode {:name "routing is fun!"})]
    (ring/response data)))

(def main-routes
  (GET "/items/:id" items#show))

(def app
  (-> (route main-routes)
      (wrap-json-response)))

(run-server app {:port 8000})
```
